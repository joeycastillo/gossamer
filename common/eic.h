  *          not enable an interrupt or event generation. You must call eic_enable_interrupt() or
  *          eic_enable_event() to either wake the processor or generate an event for a peripheral.
  * @param pin The external interrupt pin you wish to configure â€” use HAL_GPIO_xxx_PIN() macro.
  * @param trigger The condition on which you wish to trigger: rising, falling or both.
  * @param filten A boolean indicating whether to enable filtering. This causes the EIC to sample the
  *               pin three times (clocked by the EIC clock) and apply a majority vote filter.
  * @return the EIC channel number associated with the pin, or -1 if the pin is not an interrupt pin.
  * @note Be sure to check your pin multiplexing table to ensure that you do not have multiple pins
  *       assigned to the same interrupt channel. Also note that the NMI pin is not currently supported.
