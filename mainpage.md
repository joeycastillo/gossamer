Gossamer is an extremely lightweight framework for developing bare-metal firmware applications for the Microchip SAM D and SAM L series chips. Before you get started, you might want to take a look at the \ref README.md. 

After that, you can get a sense for how to implement an app with the \ref app.

You'll also want to know some stuff about the \ref system.

From there, check out all the peripherals available on most chips: 

* \ref adc
* \ref dac
* \ref eic
* \ref i2c
* \ref rtc
* \ref spi
* \ref uart
* \ref usb

There are also special peripherals that are only available on certain chips:

* The \ref slcd on the SAM L22
* The \ref opamp on the SAM L21
